        <p align="justify">The Switzerland Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria and Nestle Nigeria Plc have unveiled economic strategies aimed at addressing issues relating to unemployment and underemployment of jobless Nigerian youths, saying the economic strategies were meant to offer young people the chance of a more secured and productive future. Part of the economy-based strategic plans to address issues of unemployment in Nigeria and globally, by the leading Health and Wellness Company would cover the training of young Nigerians and Africans aimed at unlocking potentials onshore and offshore in order to shore up the technological advancement of their host countries in Africa, especially Nigeria.</p>
        <p align="justify">Gordhon, who was represented by Sola Akinyosoye, Head, Human Resource of the company, noted that the success of the programme in Nigeria and the launch of Nestle Global Youth initiative informed the decision of the company to consider the establishment of a Technical Training Center in Cote du Ivoire next year.</p>
